                    <p>Hey there! We’re a group of friends who graduated from college with one main takeaway: the vibe
                        for parties, and the ability to order pizza at 2 AM. Our story began in a small café on campus,
                        where we first met over cups of coffee (which tasted more like tap water) and talked about how
                        great it would be to throw a party that wouldn’t end with just one beer and an awkward morning
                        after.
                        <br>
                        One evening, inspired by our failed cooking attempts (it was a pizza, not meth), we decided that
                        instead of cooking, it would be much better to invite all our friends over for a house party.
                        And thus, our club was born!
                        Since then, we’ve been hosting parties that are so epic that even our houseplants started to
                        fear for their lives (seriously, one of them ran away to the neighbors). We have it all: from
                        themed karaoke nights where everyone thinks they’re a rock star, to board game tournaments that
                        end in arguments on the level of “who has the better strategy.”
                        <br>
                        Our goal is to create a space where everyone can feel free and have a great time. If you’re
                        looking for unforgettable moments, laughter until your sides hurt, and maybe a few questionable
                        dance moves (we won't judge! But the crowd will), then you’re in the right place!
                    </p>
